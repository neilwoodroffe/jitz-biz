I was initially steered towards static site generators, but they still appeared to be overkill and provided nothing that I couldn't do easier with standard html and git. However I liked the idea of markdown for speed of development, so I downloaded the [Remarkable](https://remarkableapp.github.io/index.html) Markdown Editor.
