   CGS BJJ Tournament

  <p>
   What better way to introduce this blog with the first ever “
   <a href="http://www.5thwave.com.au/cgs/">
    Contender Grappling Series
   </a>
   BJJ No-Gi Tournament”. The tournament was held at the 5th Wave Gym at 1/16 Andrew Campbell Drive, Narangba, Queensland, Australia. Chris Clem and Chad Bragdon the organisers of CGS and owners of 5th Wave Gym were really excited to promote this premier event and said that they have planned to schedule several more events in 2018. Chris also competed in the Open Event taking out the gold medal.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is nothing better than seeing two athletes battle it out in the cage and there were no shortage of submissions. But what’s great about this event is that it is also safe for kids. There was a doctor present onsite and some very experienced referees. Some of the highlights of the junior events was Charlie Higgins, daughter of Dan Higgins (no introduction required if you know BJJ and MMA in Australia) who won a gold. Plus there were the very strong Dallmann Brothers, Nate and Matty who also took home the gold.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Dallmann Brothers continued to dominated the mat with Conor taking out gold in the Adult Beginners Division, but unfortunately Will had to retire due to a knee injury. Kari Simone Pedersen took the gold in the Women’s Divsion and Simon Taylor, Coach at 5th Wave took out the gold in Advanced Division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chris and Chad really know how to put on an event, there was a BBQ, a coffee van and a jumping castle for the kids, what more can you ask for during a day out with the family. According to
   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/107470300063579/">
    CGS facebook page

   there will be 3 more events this year on 24th June, 16th September and 8th December. You can register online via the
